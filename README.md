</p>

Getting Started
===============

Take a look at sample project `TGLAugmentedRealityExample.xcodeproj`.

Usage
=====

Via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org):

* Add `pod 'TGLAugmentedRealityView', '~> 1.0'` to your project's `Podfile`

Or the "classic" way:

* Add files in folder `TGLAugmentedRealityView` to your project

Then in your project:

* Implement `TGLARViewDataSource` and `TGLARViewDelegate` protocols
* Place a `TGLARView` in your storyboard and set its `-dataSource` and `-delegate` outlets

Optionally:

* Implement `TGLARCompass` protocol
* Set `TGLARView`'s `-compass` outlet

Sample
======

Build and run `TGLAugmentedRealityExample.xcodeproj` on an iDevice. The app will run on the
simulator, too, but will give you no camera image or device orientation.

Tap the blue button and search for POIs in the map view. When finished, close the map to
reveal the AR view. The POIs will be displayed with a callout and a billboard image.

On the AR view use a horizontal pan gesture to adjust the compass heading and a pinch
gesture to adjust the zoom factor, if available in the active video format.

Requirements
============

* ARC
* iOS >= 9.3
* Xcode 9
